Cosmic Sweepers aims to enhance satellite safety by continuously tracking nearby space debris and determining whether a satellite remains within a safe orbital zone. When a potential collision risk is detected, the system recommends timely avoidance maneuvers such as altitude or velocity adjustments to prevent damage and ensure mission reliability.
